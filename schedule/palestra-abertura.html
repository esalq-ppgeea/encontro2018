        Overdispersed Count Data<br>

    Non-Gaussian outcomes are often modeled using members of the
    so-called exponential family. The Poisson model for count data falls
    within this tradition. The family in general, and the Poisson model
    in particular, are at the same time convenient since mathematically
    elegant, but in need of extension since often somewhat
    restrictive. Two of the main rationales for existing extensions are
    (1) the occurrence of overdispersion (Hinde and Demétrio 1998,
    Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 27, 151-170), in the
    sense that the variability in the data is not adequately captured by
    the model's prescribed mean-variance link, and (2) the accommodation
    of data hierarchies owing to, for example, repeatedly measuring the
    outcome on the same subject (Molenberghs and Verbeke 2005, Models
    for Discrete Longitudinal Data, Springer), recording information
    from various members of the same family, etc. There is a variety of
    overdispersion models for count data, such as, for example, the
    negative-binomial model. Hierarchies are often accommodated through
    the inclusion of subject-specific, random effects. Though not
    always, one conventionally assumes such random effects to be
    normally distributed. While both of these issues may occur
    simultaneously, models accommodating them at once are less than
    common. This paper proposes a generalized linear model,
    accommodating overdispersion and clustering through two separate
    sets of random effects, of gamma and normal type, respectively
    (Molenberghs, Verbeke and Demétrio 2007, LIDA, 13, 513-531,
    Molenberghs et al, 2010, Statistical Science, 25: 325–347,
    Vangeneugden et al, 2011, Journal of Applied Statistics, 38:
    215-232, Molenberghs, Verbeke and Demétrio 2017, SORT, 41,
    3-54). This is in line with the proposal by Booth, Casella, Friedl
    and Hobert (2003, Statistical Modelling 3, 179-181). The model
    extends both classical overdispersion models for count data (Breslow
    1984, Applied Statistics 33, 38-44), in particular the negative
    binomial model, as well as the generalized linear mixed model
    (Breslow and Clayton 1993, JASA 88, 9-25). Apart from model
    formulation, we briefly discuss several estimation options, and then
    settle for maximum likelihood estimation with both fully analytic
    integration as well as hybrid between analytic and numerical
    integration. The latter is implemented in the SAS procedure
    NLMIXED. The methodology is applied to data from a study in
    epileptic seizures.
