	In medical studies, it is common that some units under study are not susceptible to the
    event of interest, called immune or cured elements. A class of models, referred to as
    cure rate models, considers these situations and has been studied by several authors in
    the recent years. The cure fraction is of interest to patients and a useful measure to
    monitor trends and differences in survival of curable disease. In this presentation we
    discuss some alternative methods for modeling cure rate in particular the Defective
    models. Defective models have the advantage of modeling the proportion of cured
    without adding any extra parameters in the model, in contrast to the most models from
    the literature.
